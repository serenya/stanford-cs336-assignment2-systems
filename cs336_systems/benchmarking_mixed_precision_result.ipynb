    "By matching the wide dynamic range of $\\text{FP32}$, $\\text{BF16}$ offers sufficient numerical stability for operations like $\\text{LayerNorm}$, which is why modern frameworks like $\\text{PyTorch}$'s Automatic Mixed Precision ($\\text{AMP}$) typically permit $\\text{LayerNorm}$ to run in $\\text{BF16}$ without issue, whereas they force it into $\\text{FP32}$ when using $\\text{FP16}$.\n"
